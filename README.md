# UART_Implementation
    VHDL Implementation 
An Implementation of UART protocol in VHDL
  * Multiple Baud rate 
      * Two baud rate option given **9600 Baud** and **115200 Baud**
      * Baud_rate count is derived based on system clock of 12MHz.
  * The Final block consisit of a loopback where the Transmitter is connected with the receiver.
